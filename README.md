# s3-upload-api

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It contains a Lambda function to generate S3 presigned URl's to upload files to an S3 bucket. The Lambda uses Cognito as an JWT authorizer which is built from this [example repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/sessions-with-aws-sam/tree/master/cognito).
